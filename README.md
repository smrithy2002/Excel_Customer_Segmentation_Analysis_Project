# Excel Customer Segmentation Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation analysis using Excel. The dataset provided contains information about customers, including demographic and behavioral factors such as gender, age, profession, work experience, spending score, and more. The analysis aims to gain insights into customer characteristics and behaviours to inform business decisions.

## Project Steps:
## 1. Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset containing customer information:

- ID
* Gender
+ Ever_Married
- Age 
* Graduated
+ Profession
- Work_Experience
* Spending_Score
+ Family_Size
- Var_1

Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values and ensure consistency in the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Descriptive statistics were calculated for numerical variables such as Age, Work_Experience, Family_Size to understand the distribution and central tendencies.
* Visualizations were created to explore the distribution of categorical variables such as Gender, Ever_Married, Profession, Spending_Score, Var_1 using charts like column charts, pie charts, histograms, etc.
  
## Business Question Analysis:
### Ten business questions were formulated to guide the analysis:
1. Comparing the distribution of Gender
2. Analyzing Ever_Married status 
3. Investigating Age distribution
4. Exploring Professions
5. Comparing Work_Experience
6. Analyzing Spending_Score
7. Investigating Family_Size distribution
8. Examining Var_1 distribution
9. Comparing Graduated status
10. Demographic and behavioral factors

## Visualization and Dashboard Creation:
### Four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were identified and calculated:

`Total Employees`

`Average Age`


`Total Graduates`


`Marriage Status Distribution`

### Visualizations were created using Excel charts:

`Column chart for the distribution of Professions among customers`

`Pie chart for the percentage of Work_Experience among employees`

`3D clustered column chart for Spending_Score by Gender`

`Histogram for the distribution of Var_1 categories among customers`

`Clustered column chart for the distribution of Graduation status by Work_Experience`
